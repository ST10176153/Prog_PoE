# Recipe Management Application

This application is a WPF-based recipe management system that allows users to enter, view, filter, and manage recipes. It includes functionality to add ingredients and steps to recipes, calculate total calories, and filter recipes based on various criteria. The application also features a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience compared to a command-line interface.

## Features

1. **Add Recipes**: Users can add an unlimited number of recipes, each with a unique name.

2. **Add Ingredients**: For each recipe, users can add multiple ingredients, specifying the name, quantity, unit, calories, and food group.

3. **Add Steps**: Users can also add steps to each recipe, detailing the process of preparation.

4. **View Recipes**: All recipes are displayed in a list, sorted alphabetically by name.

5. **Display Recipe Details**: Users can select a recipe from the list to view detailed information, including ingredients, steps, and total calories.

6. **Filter Recipes**: Users can filter recipes based on:

- Ingredient name

- Food group

- Maximum number of calories

7. **Calorie Notification**: The software notifies the user when the total calories of a recipe exceed 300.
